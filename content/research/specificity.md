A key question is how the cell distinguishes groups of transcription factor binding sites that make up real enhancers from spurious collections of binding sites. Here we leverage our ability to design thousands of artificial enhancers to unravel the sequence features adjacent to functional versus non-functional instances of transcription factor binding sites.
