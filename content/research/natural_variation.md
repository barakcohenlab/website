Ultimately we care about the effect of variation in gene regulation on the phenotypes of organisms. To this end we are mapping and identifying *cis*-regulatory variation that affects cellular phenotypes in yeast, and we are attempting to identify the causal variants in regions identified in human genetic mapping studies.
