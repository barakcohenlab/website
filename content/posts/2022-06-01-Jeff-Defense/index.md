Congratulations to Jeff Hansen for a successful defense of his thesis, “A Test of the Pioneer Factor Hypothesis for Silent Gene Activation”. Watch [a recording of his defense here](https://wustl.box.com/s/7b7mqmcr3c8ljxxkfagp3d1bbj88rzau). Jeff is an MSTP student and will be returning to the clinic for the final two years of Medical School, so we still hope to see him around!
