The fourth annual **Cohen Research Conference** was held October 23-25, 2023 in Michigan City, IN. Lab members presented talks on big ideas or out-there experiments. Continuing the tradition from prior CRCs, we also enjoyed communal cooking, a campfire near the lake, and a dunes hike in Indiana Dunes National Park which passed through Cowles Bog, a site of seminal research on ecological succession!
