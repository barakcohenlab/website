*When the PI is away, the grad students play!*

Every year when Barak goes out of town for a long time, we prank his office as a welcome back surprise. Barak has recently taken a strong interest in Paul Cezanne, so this year we turned his office into an art gallery. We used the AI [DALL-E 2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/) to generate fake art and hung it next to real art. We used another AI called [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) to generate fake museum labels to accompany the fake art.

In addition, James used 24 photos of Barak from over the years and the "[Dreambooth](https://dreambooth.github.io)" technique to teach another AI, [Stable Diffusion](https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-public-release), what Barak looks like. Then, James asked Stable Diffusion to generate portraits of Barak in the style of several different artists. The collection of portraits is truly stunning -- there's even a museum label from ChatGPT emphasizing the mystery of the portraits' recurring subject! 

Here are some pictures of the decor. Can you tell which pieces are real works of art?
