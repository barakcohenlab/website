*It hides in black and dark genomic space\
Though with enhancers it must intervene\
And once called junk by many in old days\
It found fame in the chicken globin gene.\
The saw cHS4 had magic game\
The researchers who found it thus cried out\
O insulator thou art not the same\
Now with you loops will never be in doubt.\
But then one day a graduate student thought\
I wonder how you’ll fare in landing pads\
Alas her efforts always came to naught\
Much time was wasted chasing it in labs.\
But stay, be patient, one day you will see\
It will be fucking understood by me.*
