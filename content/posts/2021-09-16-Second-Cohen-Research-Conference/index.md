The second **Cohen Research Conference** was held September 13-15, 2021 at Lake Geneva, WI. Every conference attendee registered online for the conference and presented a talk. Other activities included communal cooking, board games, swimming and kayaking, a lakeside hike, a meditation session, science talks out on the deck, and more! A strong continuation of CRC tradition. Thanks to Clarice and Jeff, the chief organizers of the conference.
