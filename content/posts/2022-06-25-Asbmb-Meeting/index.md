Mike, Clarice, Ryan, Kai, and Yawei recently traveled to the Stowers Institute in Kansas City to attend the ASBMB conference "Evolution and Core Processes in Gene Expresson". Clarice gave a talk and everyone else presented a poster. Congratulations to Yawei, who was awarded a Best Poster Award for a graduate student!

We had a great time learning about the latest research in *cis*-regulatory grammar, enhancer evolution, and predictive models of gene regulation. We also enjoyed eating some delicious Kansas City BBQ and connecting with our peers and colleagues in the field.
