The Cohen Lab journal club meets at 10:00 AM on Wednesdays in Couch 4304.

Every few weeks, each lab member pitches an article that they have recently read. They have two minutes to sell the lab on the exciting findings and merits of the experiments. At the conclusion, the lab votes on the papers that will populate the coming weeksâ€™ discussions.
